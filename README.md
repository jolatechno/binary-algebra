# binary algebra

## What is "binary algebra" ?

Here what we mean by "binary algebra" is binary linear algebra - i.e. linear algebra inside of GF(2)^n (the [Galois field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GF(2)) of two elements - {0, 1}). In this space, we define the addition by the __xor__ operation, and the multiplication by the __and__ operation.
